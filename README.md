Tabletop Tangents is a storytelling game coming soon to <img src="https://i.kickstarter.com/tq0sfld-kickstarter-logo-green.png?origin=static&sig=f4aHZ5ZiQhwZCgzBFzJqR3WIwCUT6jVw6mALfOHvmu0%3D" alt="Kickstarter" width="200"/>

Use it for practicing improvisation, in conjunction with Dungeons and Dragons characters, and simply build your creativity and imagination. 

It's easy to play!
1. Draw a "prompt" card. The story you tell will be based on this opening line. 
2. Draw a noun card. This will have a blank space (to be filled in with an adjective).
3. Draw an adjective card. This card fills in the blank for the noun. 
4. Tell a story based on the prompt + adjective + noun cards you drew!
